    "- This notebook is the exploratory background of a proyect of transaction prediction in digital channels. The objective was to predict the future activity in two channels.\n",
    "- Fb Prophet is used in all the notebook.\n",
    "- The databases for training where subseted in different dates and different regresors. The performance for eaach training subset was recorded and a model winner was selected from 3 models, for each channel.\n",
    "- Functions to iterate trough the 6 models where built for prediction, cross validation and hyperparameter tunning. \n",
    "- The CV functions outputs performance metrics that are later fetch by another notebook to get the best model and plot the behavior trough time."
